I am a third year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Cornell University. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Eshan Chattopadhyay. Previously, I was an undergrad at UC San Diego and was very lucky to be mentored by Russell Impagliazzo and Ramamohan Paturi.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, specifically computational complexity and pseudorandomness.
