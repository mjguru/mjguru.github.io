Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Cornell University and am fortunate to be advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eshan/">Eshan Chattopadhyay</a>. Previously, I was an undergrad at UC San Diego where I had the immense pleasure to work with <a href = "https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Russell Impagliazzo</a> and <a href = "https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/">Ramamohan Paturi</a>.

I am primarily interested in theoretical computer science, specifically computational complexity and pseudorandomness. 

My email is <a href="mailto:mgurumuk@cs.cornell.edu">mgurumuk@cs.cornell.edu</a>. Here is my <a href = "/assets/pdf/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
